### Base64
| CodecID - `base64`
|-
Provides Base64 encoding and decoding functions as defined by RFC 2045 (section 6.8). and used for Encoding and Decoding an object into ASCII format.
Can handle both encode and decode operations seemlessly because of fast speeds. 
This codec operates directly on byte streams, and not character streams, it is hard-coded to only encode/decode character encodings which are compatible with the lower 127 ASCII chart (ISO-8859-1, Windows-1252, UTF-8, etc).

### Zlib (DEFLATE)
| CodecID - `zlib`
| -
| Zlib uses a combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding to compress data.|
While the decompression algorithm is the inflate method, which takes a deflate bit stream for decompression and correctly produces the original full-size data or file. 
Compresses web pages and CSS files before sending them to the browser. And therefore drastically reduces transfer time since the files are much smaller.
Zlib provides a good balance of speed and compression efficiency which makes it a widely used CoDec. 
The Dictionary size used is 32 KB.

### Blosc
| – A compressor that uses the blocking technique to reduce activity on the memory bus as much as possible. In short, this blocking technique works by dividing datasets in blocks that are small enough to fit in the caches of modern processors and perform compression/decompression there.
|-
– Blosc is meant to support all platforms where a C89 compliant C compiler can be found, such as Intel (Linux, Mac OSX and Windows) and ARM (Linux).
– Designed to transfer data to the processor cache faster than the traditional, non-compressed. Blosc compressor not only reduces the size of large datasets but also accelerates memory related computations.
– Capable of using multi threading capabilities of CPU, in order to make the compression and decompression process fast.

|-
– Primarily used to compress HTTP content in web servers and content delivery networks that results in making internet websites load faster.
– Supported and used by major web browsers due to better compression capabilities than gzip. It is similar in speed as compared to deflate but offers more dense compression.
– Compression efficiency.
JavaScript files compressed are roughly 15% smaller, CSS files are around 16% smaller and HTML files are around 20% smaller.

### Snappy
| – A compression format and program library introduced by Google and defined as a raw stream format, plus a higher-level "framing format" that can be used as a file format.
|-
– Majorly used in compressing plain text, HTML, PNGs and JPEGs
– Compression efficiency.
Compression ratio of 1.5-1.7x for plain text, about 2-4x for HTML, and 1.0x for PNGs, JPEGs and other already-compressed data.
– The compression speeds are very fast which is achieved by losing on the compression ratios, Therefore the resulting output is 20-100% larger than that of other libraries.

Compression is really high as compared to other algorithms.
Uses .lzma as file extension and variable dictionary size.

### LZS
| – LZS uses a combination of fixed Huffman coding and sliding window compression algorithm. It uses the last 2 KB of uncompressed data as a sliding-window dictionary. An LZS compressor looks for matches between the data to be compressed and the last 2 KB of data. If it finds a match, it encodes an offset/length reference to the dictionary.
|-
– It was originally developed for tape compression, and subsequently adapted for hard disk compression and later specified as a compression algorithm for various network protocols.
– Compression and decompression speeds are fairly good as compared to other CoDec.
– Dictionary size is variable and is similar to LZ77 CoDec.

### BZ2
| CodecID - `bz2`
| -
BZ2 or BZip2 is a free and open-source compression technique that uses Burrows–Wheeler algorithm and only compresses single files and not a file archiver.
| Mostly used in big data applications with cluster computing frameworks like Hadoop and Apache Spark.
| More effective than the older LZW and Deflate compression algorithms, but is considerably slower. LZMA is generally more space-efficient than bzip2 at the expense of even slower compression speed, while having much faster decompression.
|Compression ratio varies between 10% to 15% as compared to the best CoDec algorithm.

### LZ4, 
| – The LZ4 algorithm works by representing the data as a series of sequences. Each sequence begins with a one-byte token that is broken into two 4-bit fields. The first field represents the number of literal bytes that are to be copied to the output.
|-
– This algorithm provides a good combination of speed and compression. But not very useful in the latest test cases.
– Provides a smaller or we can say worse compression ratio than LZO algorithm, and even more worse when compared to DEFLATE.
– Uses .lz4 as file extension.

### LZ4HC, 
| – LZ4HC is a "high-compression" variant of LZ4 in which the compressor finds more than one match between current and past data and looks for the best match to ensure the output is small.
|-
– The Apache Hadoop system uses this algorithm for fast compression. LZ4 was also implemented natively in the Linux kernel.
–  LZ4HC has a high compression ratio but low compression speed as compared to LZ4.
– LZ4HC compression makes it possible to load individual Assets from an Asset Bundle quickly and using less memory than LZMA compressed Asset Bundles.

### LZW, 
| – LZW compression uses a table-based lookup algorithm that identifies repeated sequences in the data and adds them to the code table. Also the Decoding is achieved by taking each code from the compressed file and translating it through the code table to find what character or characters it represents.
|-
– Most commonly used to compress GIF image format served from Web sites and the TIFF image format.
– The advantage of LZW is its simplicity, fast execution.

### LZF, 
| – A Java library with no Huffman-encoding is used for encoding and decoding data in LZF format.
|-
– This algorithm is optimized for speed with an average compression ratio.
– When compared to standard Deflate algo LZF can give 5 to 6 times faster compression and 2 times faster decompression.
– Compression rate is lower since no Huffman-encoding is used.

### LZO
| – LZO is a block compression algorithm as it compresses and decompresses blocks of data. Block size must be the same for compression and decompression. LZO compresses a block of data into matches (a sliding dictionary) and runs of non-matching literals to produce good results on highly redundant data
|-
– Higher compression and decompression speeds as compared to DEFLATE compression.
– Requires an additional buffer during compression (of size 8 kB or 64 kB, depending on compression level)
– Allows the user to adjust the balance between compression ratio and compression speed, without affecting the speed of decompression.

|-
– LZFSE is used for compressing a payload for iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
– LZFSE compresses with a ratio comparable to that of zlib (DEFLATE) and decompresses two to three times faster while using fewer resources, therefore offering higher energy efficiency than zlib.
–  LZFSE is similar in speed to ZSTD (level 6), but has a slightly worse ratio.

### GZIP
| CodecID - `gzip`
|-
| Gzip is a file format and a software application used for file compression and decompression.
gzip is based on the DEFLATE algorithm, which is a combination of Huffman coding and LZ77. DEFLATE was intended as a replacement for LZW and other patent-encumbered data compression algorithms which, at the time, limited the usability of compress and other popular archivers.
| The zlib stream format, DEFLATE, and the gzip file format were standardized respectively as RFC 1950, RFC 1951, and RFC 1952.

### ZFP
| ZFP was designed to achieve high compression ratios and therefore uses lossy but optionally error-bounded compression. 
| -
| Bit-for-bit lossless compression of integer and floating-point arrays is also supported. 
| It provides compressed-array classes that support high throughput read and write random access to individual array elements and also supports serial and parallel (OpenMP and CUDA) compression of whole arrays.

### LZRW
| LZRW(Lempel–Ziv Ross Williams) refers to variants of the LZ77 lossless data compression algorithm.

– There are many variants of LZRW i.e LZRW1[2], LZRW1-A, LZRW2, LZRW3, LZRW3-A, LZRW4, LZRW5
– Both the LZRW1-A and LZRW3 use the same hash table lookups to identify matches, therefore provides (almost) identical compression results.
